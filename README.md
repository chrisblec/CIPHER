*CIPHER | Cryptocurrency Initiative for Public Honesty and Ethical Responsibility*

Crypto and DeFi project teams have an ethical duty to offer full transparency to their end users on all potential negative outcomes. CIPHER is an effort to expose the most centralized, trust-heavy parts of every crypto and DeFi application to retail users. Full transparency requires radical honesty.

CIPHER entries are not intended to be full-on tutorials or audits. The intention is to reveal the amount of trust that a user needs to put in other humans for the security of their deposits, and the best way to do that is to shine a spotlight on only the most centralized parts, without distraction.

Project team members, DAO members, or just educated users are invited to create entries for the projects that they've built or are familiar with. CIPHER entries will be committed to the repo once they are approved and potentially edited by Chris Blec.
