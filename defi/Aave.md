# AAVE

### Chainlink Multisig

[All Aave implementations utilize Chainlink as their only source of truth.](https://docs.aave.com/developers/core-contracts/aaveoracle#aaveoracle) There is no double-checking of the data received from Chainlink, and there is no backup plan in case of a Chainlink failure. 

All Chainlink price feed oracles are owned by a 4-of-9 multisig. The signers are unknown. Therefore, all Aave deposits that are utilized as loan collateral are subject to the security and integrity of the unknown signers to this multisig.

### Aave Multisigs on L2 Implementations

Most of Aaveâ€™s L2 implentations are owned by multisigs. This is not readily apparent to users without a [deep dive into Aaveâ€™s docs](https://docs.aave.com/developers/deployed-contracts/v3-mainnet).

Aave includes the following text ðŸ‘‡ in their docs regarding its L2 multisigs (Arbitrum shown as an example), however there is no way to verify whether or not Aave team holds keys to the multisig.
