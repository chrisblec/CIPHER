# Uniswap

The core functionality of Uniswap versions 1-3 are immutable and deposited funds cannot be tampered with anyone outside of the owner of the depositing wallet.

It is impossible for any human to stop the creation of new Uniswap token pairings or exchange functionality. As long as the Ethereum blockchain exists, these protocols will be capable of completing their tasks.

The effectiveness of Uniswap is based on the liquidity available, so effectiveness drops as liquidity flees due to new laws and regulations. However, the core functionality will always remain alive and well, even if it eventually becomes a graveyard.

The Uniswap company controls the official web portal, however it does not and cannot control the underlying smart contract functionality. Anyone can build a web portal connecting to the Uniswap protocols, and anyone can use Uniswap without a web portal at all if they know how.

Future versions of Uniswap may not offer this level of decentralization. For more information on the potential future of Uniswap, visit https://blec.report/uniswap/.
